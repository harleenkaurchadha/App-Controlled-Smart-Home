# App-Controlled-Smart-Home
<b>Objective</b><br>To create an App using Blynk platform in order to control and monitor home from anywhere by using interactive widgets.
It enables us to have a control over devices employed at our place by switching them on/off,controlling their intensity of operation and also set timers for their controlled operation.Moreover we can also check the light intensity and temperature of the room anytime and get notified when someone enters our place.<br><br>
<b>Description</b><br><br>
• We have used nodemcu board(ESP8266-12) to communicate to Blynk server in order to make an interactive app to xontrol and monitor home.<br>
• The value for intensity of light can be seen using a gauge widget which is provided from analog pin of nodemcu.<br>
• The value for temperature of the place can be seen using a display which is configured for virtual pin V1.
• LCD is employed in the app to provide information regarding various activities.<br>
• We can also control the intensity of lights depending on our mood using a slider widget.<br>
• Timer widget is programmed for start and stop timings of a particular device.In our case I have used relay to turn on/off my AC at particular time.<br>
• Switch is employed at digital pin to turn the device on/off.<br>
• Notification widget is employed to get notified whenever someone enters our house which can be checked using motion sensor.<br><br>
